## Event List Widget 

#### One Widget to rule them all

* One of the most requested features by Organizers when they contact CX

 Most organizers donâ€™t have the time to update their websites and add a widget for each new event, especially when they run multiple events per day or week. This widget generates a code snippet that allows organizers to integrate ALL of their live & public events on their website.<br>
 
* The integration will automatically update once a new event gets published - no manual touches needed!<br>
